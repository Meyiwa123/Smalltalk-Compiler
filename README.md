# Compiler Construction Readme
This compiler project was developed as part of an advanced study in Compiler Construction under the guidance of W.R. Lalonde. The project entails comprehensive exploration and implementation of compiler phases, encompassing lexical translators, syntactical translators, scope handlers, type checkers, code generators, and optimizers. The primary objective is to develop a fully functional compiler using the Smalltalk programming language.

## Compiler concept
This compiler project explores advanced concepts in compiler construction. It covers table-driven scanner/parser operation, including finite state machines (FSMs) and regular expressions (REs) in transduction grammars. Theoretical aspects such as regular grammars, context-free grammars, parse trees, and LL(k) versus LR(k) grammars are also discussed.

Additionally, the project delves into constructing tables for regular right part grammars, involving readahead FSMs, readback FSMs, and semantic action states for tree building. Techniques for managing scoping in typical programming languages through symbol tables are explored for efficient symbol resolution and management.

## Installation
To run the MangaDex Manga Viewer locally, follow these steps:
1. Clone the repository: git clone [repository_url]
2. Change to the project directory: cd [project_directory]

## Usage
1. Execute `VDEVW.EXE` and you'll be able to see the smalltalk window
2. Enter `Constructor new` in the cosole, highlight, right-click and select do it.
